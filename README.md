****************************************************************************************************************
Some of the projects on my portfolio page wont be present because they have seperate git repos and I couldn't

figure out how to include them on this repo. But I assure you they are present and run perfectly in the iframe

on my computer using a second local host as the. You can still play a much crappier version of snake that I 

made and another crappy go board that doesn't really work and you can't play with other people yet anyway :)
